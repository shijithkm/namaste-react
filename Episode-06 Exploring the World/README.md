# What i learned from Episode-06 EXploring the world ? ðŸš€

# Monolith Architecture 
- Everything was written together in one big project => API, UI, DB connection, SMS ..etc 
- Hard to make change which required to build the complete application 

# Microservices 
- API, UI , Auth are considered as different project 
- It follow single responsibility principle 
- Team can indipendently work and different deployment cycle/pipeline 
- Flexibility to choose differenct lang for diff project 

# When to make an api call 
- App loads make an api call and render into ui (Loads=>API=>Render)
- Loads => Render => API => Rerender 
    => This is the better approach 
    => This gives better UX
